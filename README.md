# Centrinel #

Restrict some C structs to reside in specific regions of the heap.

## Motivation ##

When using C to implement a runtime for a programming language, we may want to
distinguish internal runtime data structures (allocated using `malloc`/`free`
or some kind of memory pool or perhaps `mmap`ed from a dumped image) from user
objects allocated in a GC managed heap.

In [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) the runtime represents managed objects that derive
from `System.Object` using a C struct `typedef struct _MonoObject { ... } MonoObject`.  Mono uses the convention that a class dervies from class `T` if its first member is of type T:

```c
struct _MonoString {
	MonoObject obj; /* System.String derives from System.Object */
	...
};
```

Mono is transitioning to a regime where pointers to managed memory `MonoObject
*ptr` must be accessed by the runtime internals indirectly via handles<sup id="ref1">[1](#f1)</sup>: `MonoObjectHandle h`

This package provides a library that analyzes C files to find places where raw pointers to managed memory are used.

## Installation ##

This is an early development prototype, so the setup is a bit involved.

You will need a recent GHC (tested with GHC 8.0.x, but 7.10.x will probably
work too, and possibly 7.8 with minor patching).

Dependencies: This program uses the `language-c` library for C parsing - you
will need the `alex` lexer and `happy` parser installed (either systemwide or
in the sandbox for this repository).  The steps below setup a sandbox and
install the needed programs into it. (You don't need `alex` and `happy` to run
the analysis, just to build the analyzer binary.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lambdageek/centrinel.git
cd centrinel
cabal sandbox init
cabal install happy
cabal install alex
cabal install --dependencies-only
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal install     # needed to get include/centrinel.h in the right place
```

### The `include/centrinel.h` header ###

The last step of the installation instructions, above, copies the centrinel
header [include/centrinel.h](include/centrinel.h) to the right place (in the
sandbox) so that centrinel can find it.

This header defines `__CENTRINEL__` to `1` to indicate that centrinel is
running; `__CENTRINEL_MANAGED_ATTR` attribute and `__CENTRINEL_MANAGED_REGION`
attribute specifier that you can use to annotate your structs, as well as
macros to define away certain GCC primitives that are not understood by
`language-c`.

The header is automatically included by centrinel, you don't have to include it explicitly.

## Usage ##

You should now be able to play around with it using `cabal run centrinel --
[ARGS]` (or `cabal repl` if you want to run the various steps separately).
Additionally, there is a script `centrinelcc` which can be used as `CC` in
`make` invocations as a drop-in replacement for `gcc` or `clang`.

### Just run the binary on a C file ###

Usage: `centrinel -- CFLAGS CFILE`

The program understands a modicum of `cc` command line options such as `-D` and
`-I` and `-U` and will pass others through to the preprocessor.  A few options
that don't make sense for preprocessing (such as `-c` or `-MT` are understood
and silently dropped).

```
$ cabal run centrinel -- c-examples/attrib.c

```

### Replace `CC` in a make ###

The file [`scripts/centrinelcc`](scripts/centrinelcc) can be used as the value of the `CC` variable for `make`.
It will first run the real compiler (specified by the `REAL_CC` environment variable, or `cc` if unset) and
if compilation succeeds, it will invoke `centrinel` (which must be on the path)

#### Setup ####

These steps are not automated yet

```
cabal install
cp dist/build/centrinel/centrinel [somewhere on your PATH]
cp scripts/centrinelcc [somewhere on your PATH]
```

#### Example ####

```
$ export REAL_CC=/path/to/your/cc # if unset, defaults to 'cc'
$ make CC=centrinelcc
```


## What works ##

* Region annotations on struct definitions (specified by
  `__attribute__((__region(N)))` with integer *N*) will be unified with regions
  inferred for the first member of the struct (provided it's another struct
  type) and conflicts will be reported.

* Pointers to structs **in region `__CENTRINEL_MANAGED_REGION`** (defined as
  `__region(1)` in `include/centrinel.h`) will elicit an error if they occur
  anywhere in a function prototype (either a declaration or a definition).

## What's planned ##

* Checking of function bodies for use of `__CENTRINEL_MANAGED_REGION` pointers.

* A way of annotating blessed functions/structs that are allowed to manipulate
  pointers to the managed heap without an error.

<b id="f1">1</b>: One immediate benefit is that if a garbage collection happens while native runtime code is running, we don't have to pin the referenced object, which may reduce fragmentation. [â†©](#ref1)
